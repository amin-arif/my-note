## **Recursive Common Table Expression**

To retrieve all children or sub-branches of a selected branch when you have a table with `branch_id` and `parent_branch_id` columns, you can use a recursive common table expression (CTE) in PostgreSQL. This allows you to traverse the hierarchical structure of branches. Here's how you can do it:

Assuming you have a table named `branches` with columns `branch_id` and `parent_branch_id`, and you want to retrieve all children of a selected branch with a known `branch_id`, you can use a recursive CTE. Here's an example query:

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE branch_hierarchy AS (
    SELECT branch_id, parent_branch_id
    FROM branches
    WHERE branch_id = :selected_branch_id -- Replace with the selected branch_id
    UNION ALL
    SELECT b.branch_id, b.parent_branch_id
    FROM branches AS b
    JOIN branch_hierarchy AS bh ON b.parent_branch_id = bh.branch_id
)
SELECT branch_id
FROM branch_hierarchy;
```

In this query:

1. We start by defining a recursive CTE named `branch_hierarchy`.

2. In the initial part of the CTE, we select the `branch_id` and `parent_branch_id` for the branch with the specified `branch_id` (`:selected_branch_id`). This serves as the anchor member of the recursion.

3. In the recursive part of the CTE, we join the `branches` table (`b`) with the CTE (`bh`) to find the children of the branches already selected in previous iterations.

4. We continue this recursion until there are no more child branches to retrieve.

5. Finally, we select all `branch_id` values from the `branch_hierarchy` CTE, which will give you all the children (and sub-children) of the selected branch.

You need to replace `:selected_branch_id` with the actual branch ID you want to select. This query will return all the children, grandchildren, and so on for the specified branch in a hierarchical manner.
