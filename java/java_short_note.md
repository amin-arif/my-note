### 1. What is Java ?

Java is a high level, platform independent programming language. It is used to develop web, mobile, desktop applications.

### 2. Java Features

    i. Platform Independent
    ii. OOP Concepts
    iii. Multi-threaded
    iv. High Performance (for JIT)

### 3. Java Compiler & JIT

* **Java Compiler:** Java Compiler (javac) compile the java files in compile time and generate bytecodes (intermediate language).
* **JIT:** JIT in Java is an integral part of the JVM. Java uses JIT (Just In Time) to enable high performance. JIT converts the bytecode into machine language and then JVM starts the execution. [learn more](https://www.javatpoint.com/jit-in-java)

## **OOP**

</br>

### 1. Class & Object

* Class:
* Object:

### 2. Key Points

* ...

### 3. Inheritance

* Inheritance is only applicable to the public and protected members only. Private members canâ€™t be inherited.

### 4. Encapsulation

* Binding (or wrapping) code and data together into a single unit are known as encapsulation. For example, a capsule, it is wrapped with different medicines.
* Encapsulation is an oop concept that is used to implement abstraction. Encapsulation is achieved using access modifiers (public, private, protected, package, default).

### 5. Polymorphism

* Polymorphism means many forms. Where an object behaves differently in different situations.
* Compile time polymorphism is achieved by method overloading.
* Run time polymorphism is achieved by method overriding.

### 6. Abstraction

* Abstraction is the concept of hiding the internal details and express it in a simple way.
* It can achieved in many ways in OOP such as encapsulation and polymorphism.
* There are two types of abstraction.

        i. Data Abstraction
        ii. Process Abstraction

* Example: A car. It can start by pressing a button, but the user don't know how the car engine is start. The car internal implementation and complex logic is completely hidden from the user.
