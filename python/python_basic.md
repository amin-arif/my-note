## **1. Comment**

Single line comment:
```python
# Single line comment
```

Comment more than one line:
```python
# Be sciencere
# Be patient
```
Or
```python
"""
This is a multiline comment.
Actually, Python has not any syntax for multiline comment.

As long as string is not assigned to a variable, Python will read the code, but then ignore it.
"""
```

## **2. Variable**
```python
variable = value
```

Multiple variable assigned in one line:
```python
intNumber, strText, floatNumber = 111, "Python is an interpreted language", 3.1416

print(intNumber, strText, floatNumber) # 111 Python is an interpreted language 3.1416
```

Assign same value in multiple variables:
```python
var1 = var2 = var3 = "Alhamdulillah"

print(var1, var2, var3) # Alhamdulillah Alhamdulillah Alhamdulillah
```
