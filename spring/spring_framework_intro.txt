	Why Spring?
	--> To simplify Java Enterprise Development
	
[2] ###
	Spring Goals:
	i) Lightweight development with Java POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects).
	ii) Dependency Injection to promote loose coupling.
	iii) Declarative programming with Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP).
	iv) Minimize boilerplate Java code.

	---------- Spring Framework Overview ----------
	Core Container ----> Beans, Core, SpEL (Spring Expression Language), Context
	--> It creates beans using Bean Factory and manages beans dependencies
	
	Insfrustructure ----> AOP, Aspects, Instrumentation (JMX), Messaging
	
	Data Access Layer ----> JDBC, ORM, Transactions, JMS (Java Message Service), OXM 
	
	Web Layer ----> Servlet, WebSocket, Web, Portlet
	
	Test Layer ----> Unit, Integration, Mock

	Spring Framework is developed on two core concepts - Dependency Injection and Aspect Oriented Programming (Spring AOP).

	AOP: Aspect Oriented Programming allows to create application oriented services	which add functionality to objects declaratively
	(Logging, Security, Transactions, Instrumentation etc). Example: We declare project configuration in a properties files (declarative)
	and AOP turns into the object to run the application.
