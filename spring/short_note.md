1. **What is Spring Bean?**

> In Spring, the objects that form the backbone of your application and that are managed by the Spring IoC container are called beans. A bean is an object that is instantiated, assembled, and otherwise managed by a Spring IoC container.

<br>

2. **What is Spring IoC Container?**

> Simply put, Inversion of Control (IoC) is a process in which an object defines its dependencies without creating them. This object delegates the job of constructing such dependencies to an IoC container. 

<br>

3. **@PostConstruct and @PreDestroy**

> **@PostConstruct:** tells Spring to run the function after the beanâ€™s properties were initialized. A method with @PostConstruct will run even there is nothing to initialize. (Behavior like constructor)

> **@PreDestroy:** A method annotated with @PreDestroy runs only once, just before Spring removes our bean from the application context. (Behavior like destructor)

> Both @PostConstruct and @PreDestroy can have any access level, but can not be static. 

<br>

4. **What is Hibernate?**

> Hibernate is an implementation of JPA

<br>

6. **Spring Context:**

> When a spring application run, all dependent objects of the application are loaded or created into spring context (Bean created).

<br>

7. **Dependency Injection**
	
> Dependency Injection (DI) is a design technique that removes dependencies from computer code, making the application easier to maintain and test. 

> It makes programming code loosely coupled.

> Three types of dependency injections:

	i. Field Injection
	ii. Constructor Injection
	iii. Setter Injection

```java
// Field Injection example
@Autowired
EmpRepo epmRepo;

// Constructor Injection example
EmpRepo epmRepo;
@Autowired
public EmpConstructor(EmpRepo epmRepo) {
	this.empRepo = empRepo;
}

// Setter Injection example
EmpRepo epmRepo;
@Autowired
public void setEmpRepo(EmpRepo epmRepo) {
	this.empRepo = empRepo;
}
```

<br>

8. **Implemetation Cofiguration:**
> How Spring knows which implementation to be inject

	i. @Primary
	ii. @Qualifier("empRepoImpl2")

<br>

9. **Stereotype Annotations**

> Stereotype annotations are used to create Spring beans automatically in the application context.
> [Read more](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/spring-stereotype-annotations/)

	1. @Component
	2. @Service
	3. @Repository
	4. @Controller
