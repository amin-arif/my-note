## **1. JPA**

* JPA (Java Persistence API) is just a specification that facilitates object-relational mapping (ORM) to manage relational data in Java applications. It provides a platform to work directly with objects instead of using SQL statements.


* The JPA is the Java API for the management of persistence and object relational mapping in Java EE and Java SE environments. It provides an object relational mapping facility for the Java application developer using a Java domain model to manage a relational database.
