**----------------- SOLID Principles -----------------**

- S -> Single Responsibility
- O -> Open Closed
- L -> Liskov Substitution
- I -> Interface Segregation
- D -> Dependency Inversion

</br>

### 1. Single Responsibility

```txt
Each class should have only one sole purpose, and not be filled with excessive functionality.
```

### 2. Open Closed

```txt
Classes should be open for extension, closed for modification.
In other words, you should not have to rewrite an existing class for implementing new features.
```

### 3. Liskob Substitution

```txt
This means that every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent class.

If class B is subtype of class A, then we should be able to replace object of A by object of B without breaking the behavior of the program. Subclass should extend the capability of parent class not narrow it down.
```

### 4. Interface Segregation

```txt
Interfaces should not force classes to implement what they can't do.
Large interface should be divided into small ones.
```

### 5. Dependency Inversion

```txt
Class should depend on interfaces, rather than concrete classes.

Components should depend on abstractions, not on concretions.
```
